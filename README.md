# Secure Registration and Login System Project in C++

## Project Overview

The Secure Registration and Login System Project in C++ is a comprehensive open-source initiative that demonstrates the implementation of critical security features using the C++ programming language. This project is designed to provide a practical example of how to create a secure user registration, login, and password management system. By integrating various C++ concepts like switch case statements, loops, arrays, and file handling, this project serves as an educational resource and practical reference for anyone interested in enhancing authentication within their C++ applications.

## Key Features

1. **User Registration:** Utilize switch case statements to allow users to register by entering essential details such as username, email, and password.

2. **User Login:** Implement a secure login mechanism using C++ to validate user credentials, ensuring that only authorized users gain access.

3. **Password Management:** Demonstrate secure password storage and provide a mechanism for users to change their passwords.

4. **File Handling:** Use C++ file handling operations to manage user data storage and retrieval, ensuring data persistence between sessions.

5. **Change Password:** Enable users to change their passwords through C++ programming, adding a layer of user-controlled security.

## Usage

- **User Registration:** Launch the application and follow the prompts to register a new user account with the required information.

- **User Login:** Authenticate users by entering their username and password, ensuring secure access to the application.

- **Password Management:** Access the password management feature to change your password if desired.
